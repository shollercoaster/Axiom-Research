## Importance of philosophy
- Building First Principle thinking
- Self awareness
- Logic and bringing new results
- Research and stepping into boundary of undiscovered knowledge
- Articulation is better 

## Goals of Philosophy
- Express our views, solidify stance on different schools of thought
- Linguistic advantages
- Self development 

# Branches of Philosophy
## Metaphysics
## Epistemology 
- Knowledge means latching on facts 
- Knowledge isn't belief
- Skepticism, knowledge = belief + truth + confidence and also good basis?
## Ethics
- Laws: just/unjust, rules to guide judgement
- Morality: social pressures, give set of answers to basic ethical questions
	- Usually moral formative process is subconscious
- Ethics: 
	- based on conscious reflection, on our motives and purposes
	- outside the purview of morality and laws 

# Modern Philosophy

## Rationalist 
- Focused on reason and faculties above sense

## Empiricist
- Focused on experiences and that which is attained by senses

## Kant's Account of Reason
- Central questions:
	- Theoretical: Can reasoning answer questions beyond the physical world (metaphysical world)
	- Practical: Can reason guide action and justify moral principles?
- Limits of reasoning: cannot give knowledge of god, falls into contradiction
- The green spectacle example: Phenomenal reality (physical realm through our spectacles) vs Noumenal reality (actual unpassable unknowable realm)
- Newtonian and relative science talk about the physical realm through our spectacles. 

# Aristotle
- All rounder
- What makes people happy? 
	- Good and successful people followed 11 virtues (always between 2 vices: **Golden Mean**)
	- Had a definitive list of all 11 virtues in deficiency, mean and excess amounts.
	- Change is possible
- What is art for?
	- Why tragedy befalls good people?  
	- Catharsis and pity: leading a life with caution
	- Jack lands Rose, but the titanic sinks
- What are true friends for?
	- Sometimes fun, sometimes strategic allegiance
	- Friendship teaches us who to be, community wins
- how can ideas cut through?
	- Audience can be gauged not just through logic
	- Confidence wins debate, not logic
	- Rhetoric: Smart people must learn the skills to convince other people

# Deontology
- Immanuel Kant: Ethical actions follow universal moral lies (don't lie, steal or cheat)
- Intuition of what is or isn't ethical, avoids subjectivity
- Eg: let missile launch, or hack into the system

# Role of Reason in Philosophy
- Irrational vs incohorent (political biases, sound reality yet flawed judgement)

# Dualism and Materialism
- Materialism:
	- only thing truly proven to exist is physical matter
	- So all entities are the result of material interactions
	- Related to physicalism, in contrast with idealism and solipsism
	- Physicalism = sophisticated notion on wave particles and nothing supernatural
- Dualism:
	- Physical and mental are separate, but what is the mind?
	- mind and the body are separate
	- Mind = immaterial, non-spatial, private, non-observer and susceptible to feelings
	- Body = physical, concrete and observable entity
	- Yet Descartes: body is controlled by mind hence they interact
		- But how? Psychophysical parallelism: in sync so delusion of interaction, yet they are only parallely functional (synced clocks)

# Philosophy of Consciousness
- Descartes' Mind Body Problem
- Emotions and feelings = ripples on lake of soul
# Political Philosophy
