# Axiom Research

Axiom is the Philosophy Society of NSUT. This is the all-encompassing repository of all Axiom Research documents. Here we capture the notes for our SIGs (Special Interest Groups), special presentations, deep-dives, research ventures, opinion pieces and any philosophy-centric research.
