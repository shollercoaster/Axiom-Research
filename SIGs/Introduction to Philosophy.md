## Rationalist 
- Focused on reason and faculties above sense

## Empiricist
- Focused on experiences and that which is attained by senses

## Kant's Account of Reason
- Central questions:
	- Theoretical: Can reasoning answer questions beyond the physical world (metaphysical world)
	- Practical: Can reason guide action and justify moral principles?
- Limits of reasoning: cannot give knowledge of god, falls into contradiction
- The green spectacle example: Phenomenal reality (physical realm through our spectacles) vs Noumenal reality (actual unpassable unknowable realm)
- Newtonian and relative science talk about the physical realm through our spectacles.
