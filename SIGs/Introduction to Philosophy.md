# Intro

## What is Philosophy?
- literally, "love of wisdom"
- why do you do what you do, why do you think what you think, why do you feel what you feel
- way of thinking about questions
- every time you make a decision, or chose a side, have a particular way to go about things, you're philosophizing, as you're thinking about the world and your place in it
- how to think?

## Importance of philosophy
- Building First Principle thinking
- Self awareness
- Logic and bringing new results
- Research and stepping into boundary of undiscovered knowledge
- Articulation is better 

## Goals of Philosophy
- Express our views, solidify stance on different schools of thought
- Linguistic advantages
- Self development 

### Philosophy vs Science
- studies that had strong empirical elements came to be considered science - a search for answers
- but philosophy came to be understood more as a way of thinking about questions

# Branches of Philosophy
## Metaphysics
- Immanuel kant called it “a bottomless abyss” or a “dark ocean w/o a shore”
- Meta - after; physics - physics
- Philosophical discipline concerned w/ the fundamental nature of reality
- what does it mean to be something? what does it mean to be a human or a table? how is it different? pretty abstract way of thinking
- not asking questions like, "where does the time go?" but "why does time move at all?", or "what particles are there?" but "why are there particles in the first place?"
- the two underlying themes of metaphysics
	- the study of first causes - a first cause is that which does not change and from which emanates the things in this world we experience, eg. God
	- the study of being - study of that which is, or that which exists
- radio waves have always existed, but we've only recently been able to discover and devise a technology to harness their power. similarly, there can be things that have always existed in their truest sense, but we just haven't discovered or understood them that deeply
- problem of free will, mid-body problem
## Epistemology 
- Knowledge means latching on facts 
- Knowledge isn't belief
- Skepticism, knowledge = belief + truth + confidence and also good basis?
## Ethics
- "a man w/o ethics is a wild beast loosed upon this world"
- socrates is one of the first moral philosophers
- study of good and bad; what are good and bad ends to pursue in life and what it is right and wrong to do in the conduct of life
- it is a practical discipline, unlike metaphysics

### Difference between Laws, Morality
- Laws: just/unjust, rules to guide judgement
- Morality: social pressures, give set of answers to basic ethical questions
	- Usually moral formative process is subconscious
- Ethics: 
	- based on conscious reflection, on our motives and purposes
	- outside the purview of morality and laws 

# Ancient Philosophy  
- egyptian - field of reeds(afterlife or paradise), the central qstn egyptians dealt w/ was
- how should a person live in order to ensure they would go to paradise
	indian - vedas, upanishads(composed in order to explain aspects of vedic texts), eventually charvaka, jainism and buddhism came around
	greek - thales of miletus, raised questions regarding the basic nature of the universe, pre-socratic era
# Modern Philosophy

## Rationalist 
- Focused on reason and faculties above sense

## Empiricist
- Focused on experiences and that which is attained by senses

## Kant's Account of Reason
- Central questions:
	- Theoretical: Can reasoning answer questions beyond the physical world (metaphysical world)
	- Practical: Can reason guide action and justify moral principles?
- Limits of reasoning: cannot give knowledge of god, falls into contradiction
- The green spectacle example: Phenomenal reality (physical realm through our spectacles) vs Noumenal reality (actual unpassable unknowable realm)
- Newtonian and relative science talk about the physical realm through our spectacles. 

# Contemporary Philosophy
present period in the history of western philosophy beginning at the early 20th century, with increasing professionalization of the discipline
eg, ludwig wittgenstein who stated that "all philosphical problems arise from misunderstandings of the logic of language, and it tries to show what this logic is
eg, albert camus whose philosophy revolves around absurdism, i.e. the universe is irrational and meaningless

# Socrates
executed by the Athenian state on the charges of religious impiety and corruption of the youth
didn't write anything, most of what we know about him is through other sources, such as works of plato or xenophon
Socrates is known for proclaiming his total ignorance; he used to say that the only thing he was aware of was his ignorance, seeking to imply that the realization of our ignorance is the first step in philosophizing.
"the only true wisdom is knowing you know nothing"
always question yourself, and keep trying to know yourself better, keep refining your ideas regarding everything
skepticism, critical questioning, reasoning, and prioritization of knowledge to achieve happiness
often regarded as the father of western philosophy

# Plato
devoted his life to one goal: helping people reach a state of what is termed as: eudaimonia(or fulfilment)
student of socrates
wrote a lot of books such as the republic, the symposium, the apology, etc.
some of his big ideas for making life more fulfilled :
	1.think more, do not go along w/ popular opinions, think for yourself, know yourself
	2.decode the message of beauty : everyone likes beautiful things, but why? acc to plato, it happens so because beautiful things are whispering to us important truths to us about the good life, such as modesty, generosity, harmony, etc. we find things beautiful when we sense in them the qualities we need but are missing in our lives. acc to him, art is therapeutic, and it is the duty of poets and painters to help us live a good life
	3.he was a utopian thinker and tried to churn out ideas that can help people lead more fulfilled lives. his ideas were there for the reformation of the society. he believed that a society should have good role models, and therefore wanted to give athens celebrities consisting of ideally wise and good people he called Guardians. he also wanted to end democracy in athens, not because he wanted some horrid dictatorship, but because he believed most people voted w/o thinking and so people should only be allowed to vote once they've learned to think rationally, i.e. become philosopher
# Aristotle
- All rounder
- What makes people happy? 
	- Good and successful people followed 11 virtues (always between 2 vices: **Golden Mean**)
	- Had a definitive list of all 11 virtues in deficiency, mean and excess amounts.
	- Change is possible
- What is art for?
	- Why tragedy befalls good people?  
	- Catharsis and pity: leading a life with caution
	- Jack lands Rose, but the titanic sinks
- What are true friends for?
	- Sometimes fun, sometimes strategic allegiance
	- Friendship teaches us who to be, community wins
- how can ideas cut through?
	- Audience can be gauged not just through logic
	- Confidence wins debate, not logic
	- Rhetoric: Smart people must learn the skills to convince other people

# Idealism
metaphysical view that reality is ultimately mental in nature, and mental can mean a lot of things here, such as soul, mind, will, spirit, consciousness, experience, etc.
ideas are the only reality
emphasis on ideas, feelings, ideals than materialistic things; mind & self are more important than matter & body
material world doesnt exist for an idealist as it is destructible & mutable/dynamic, i.e. it is ever-changing, whereas ideas remain constant
platonic idealism: the forms

# Utilitarianism 
moral theory that focuses on the results, or consequences, of our actions, and treats intentions as irrelevant 
it advocates actions that foster happiness and oppose actions that cause unhappiness
promotes "the greatest amount of good for the greatest no. of people"
# Deontology
- Immanuel Kant: Ethical actions follow universal moral lies (don't lie, steal or cheat)
- Intuition of what is or isn't ethical, avoids subjectivity
- Eg: let missile launch, or hack into the system

# Role of Reason in Philosophy
- Irrational vs incohorent (political biases, sound reality yet flawed judgement)

# Dualism and Materialism
- Materialism:
	- only thing truly proven to exist is physical matter
	- So all entities are the result of material interactions
	- Related to physicalism, in contrast with idealism and solipsism
	- Physicalism = sophisticated notion on wave particles and nothing supernatural
- Dualism:
	- Physical and mental are separate, but what is the mind?
	- mind and the body are separate
	- Mind = immaterial, non-spatial, private, non-observer and susceptible to feelings
	- Body = physical, concrete and observable entity
	- Yet Descartes: body is controlled by mind hence they interact
		- But how? Psychophysical parallelism: in sync so delusion of interaction, yet they are only parallely functional (synced clocks)
	-
# Philosophy of Consciousness
- Descartes' Mind Body Problem
- Emotions and feelings = ripples on lake of soul
- Dualism: 
	- soul is not a part of the physical brain
	- Rene Descartes: Res cognita (mental thoughts) vs Res extensa (physical objects taking space)
	- One can exist without the another
- Physicalists: 
	- John Searle: consciousness is a biological condition of our existence
	- Brain is severely underresearched (walking example)
	- Inability to make a conscious machine: Chinese Room

# Role of Reason in Philosophy
## Empiricism vs Rationalism
- Empiricism:
	- sense experience is the ultimate source of all our concepts and knowledge.
	- Rejects reason

- Rationalism:
	- 3 claims outside of sense experience:
		- Intuition/Deduction
		- Innate Knowledge (experience triggers deliberate knowledge)
		- Innate concept (application of concept)
